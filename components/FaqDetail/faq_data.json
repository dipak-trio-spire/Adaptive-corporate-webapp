                    "answer": "<p>Portfolio Risk Contribution ranks sources of a portfolio’s overall risk in the volatility of individual position holdings, helping you identify where risk is coming from. You may find some of the results surprising, especially when the portfolio includes riskier individual positions which are diversified (that is, they don’t tend to move together).</p> <p><br></p> <p>• <strong>Bars Show Risk Contribution of Position.</strong> Each bar reflects how much of the overall portfolio’s volatility comes from a specific holding, which is a function in part of the weight of that holding in the portfolio. Bars for all portfolio positions should sum to 100%, though the total may be subject to rounding errors.</p> <p>There are some nuances. Please contact us for more technical information—bars are computed using not only the weight of the stock in the portfolio and the implied volatility of the stock, but also an adjustment based on the correlation of such stock with the rest of the portfolio. This essentially calculates a “marginal” risk contribution for changes in the Portfolio Risk when adding an additional unit of said stock. Because of the correlation adjustments, a negatively correlated position will have a negative bar height signifying negative Risk Contribution—reducing the weight of a negatively correlated position, in other words will raise Portfolio Risk, and adding the weight of a negatively correlated position will reduce Portfolio Risk. The portfolio’s overall risk may be lower than individual components thanks to the benefits of diversification, which is a powerful allocation strategy for reducing risk.

Dots, in contrast to bars, are not affected by a position’s weight in the portfolio.</p> <p><br></p> <p>• <strong>Horizontal Blue Line Shows Market Risk.</strong> We currently use the VIX as our measure of market risk, though this may be refined further in the future. The VIX, often called the ‘fear index’ or ‘fear gauge’, is roughly a reading of the implied volatility of the S&P 500 for the coming 30 days, as calculated from the price of publicly traded options on the S&P 500. You can think of this line as the ‘position risk’ of the S&P 500, to compare whether individual positions are reading as more or less volatile than the market as a whole.

The interaction of Simulation Length, Protection Period, and Protection Level can affect these results.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>• Protection Renewals.</strong>If the Simulation Length is longer than Protection Period, say five years of Simulation Length and one year of Protection Period, then the simulation assumes renewals of the downside protection at the same Protection Level and Protection Period. This assumption can greatly affect simulation results in part because the Protection Level is expressed as a percentage, so renewals for a rising portfolio will have higher dollar levels of protection, and likewise renewals for a falling portfolio will have lower dollar levels of protection.</p> <p>There are a few nuances: (1) any Protection Payouts are added to the market value of the portfolio, in effect simulating reinvestment at the lower prices and, in an overall rising market, using Protection Payouts to ‘buy the dips’ as a potentially potent form of countering <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/compoundingdarkside.asp'>negative compounding</a>; (2) whether there are Protection Payouts or not, the Forward Test finances Protection renewals out of the market value of the portfolio, meaning that there is some rebalancing to maintain portfolio allocations; (3) the Forward Test uses the current implied market volatility as its assumption for the cost of any renewals during the simulations, but in the real world the cost of renewals will be affected by the market conditions which might price protection higher or lower than current levels.</p>"

To address this, it is important to use realistic and well-calibrated inputs, and to perform sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results to different assumptions.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Please contact us for more technical information. Forecasting tools tend to assume long-term growth in stocks, in keeping with long-term trends. Adaptive’s Forward Test, however, does not currently assume growth—instead it assumes a market on the whole that goes nowhere even though this likely underestimates the gains in long-term portfolios. Some of other Adaptive’s inputs include: historical returns for correlation estimates; implied volatility for calculating forward returns; and historical volatility, in part as a sanity check for implied volatility calculations.</p>"
